## USAGE

### Translator

To use the translator execute with python the program `translate.py` with the option `-s`\\`--sentence` written directly as an argument. For example:
~~~
python translate.py -s "mi moku e kili"
~~~

With the option `-f`\\`--file` you can pass as an argument a text file containing a sentence per line. For example:

~~~
python translate.py -f "test.txt"
~~~

### Sentence Generator

In order to use the sentence generator. We can just execute the program `generate.py` with python:

~~~
python generate.py
~~~

In addition, we can use the option `-n`\\`--number` to indicate the number of desired generated sentences:

~~~
python generate.py -n 10
~~~

### Parser

The parser is used just executing the program `CYK_Parser.py` without arguments:

~~~
python CYK_Paser.py
~~~

After that, the program will ask you to input the sentence. After that it will tell you if the sentence is correct or not.
